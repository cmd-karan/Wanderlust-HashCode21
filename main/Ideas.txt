Shortest paths  - preferrable

Least redlight path

what is required from input?

simulationTime
intersectionCount
streetCount
scorePerCar

startNode, endNode - edgeName - edgeTime
carId - streetCount - list of edgeNames - (easily create intersections to be traversed)

carId

carId - [0,2,4,5,6] (list of nodes to traverse)

carID - (list of nodes to traverse)

queue at a first streeet based on the carID

Intersection - node
question?

For every node  -
 check the output node from it
 create this maping
assign 1 sec to every output from the given node
and send it to the schedule

Submission - 

Node 
startNodeCount
for startNode in graph[endNode]:
    streetName -startNode, endNode
    T = 1 (always)
    

make specify classes - cars, intersection, street
