Shortest paths  - preferrable

Least redlight path

what is required from input?

simulationTime
intersectionCount
streetCount
scorePerCar

startNode, endNode - edgeName - edgeTime
carId - streetCount - list of edgeNames - (easily create intersections to be traversed)

carId

carId - [0,2,4,5,6] (list of nodes to traverse)

carID - (list of nodes to traverse)



make specify classes - cars, intersection, street
